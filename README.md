### _Introduction:_
_Chronic Kidney Disease has affected 10% of our current population. According to the studies, CKD which was earlier ranked at 27 most deadly diseases that are a cause of total deaths in 1990 escalated substantially to 18th in 2010. It serves as the major cause for kidney failure and acts as the parent disease which gives birth to many other disorders like heart diseases, nerve damage, high blood pressure, etc. to the patient that is suffering from it.
The factor that contributes to making Chronic Kidney Detection as one of the deadliest diseases is the fact that there is no common, strong and individual factor that acts as the deciding factor in differentiating a sick individual from the healthy one. This further resists the swift and precise diagnosis of this illness by the medical researchers and doctors. Using the notion of Supervised Machine Learning it is possible to make the model learn various data patterns and perform clas-sification._ 

### _Purpose/Motivation:_ 
_Chronic Kidney Disease or CKD is one of the most widespread Kidney diseases that affect people on a larger scale. It gives rise to other biological problems like weak bones, anemia, nerve damage, high blood pressure and can even lead to complete kidney failure. Millions of deaths are caused each year because of CKD. The diagnosis of CKD is a problematic job as there is no major symptom that serves a classification feature in detecting this disease._
